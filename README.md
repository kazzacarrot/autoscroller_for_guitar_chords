There are like 3 parts to this: file exploration, song choosing and song play. 
Instructions:

You will soon see a crude file explorer. Use the left and right arrow keys to navigate and the return key to enter a directory. You can go up a level (return to the previous folder) by pressing the up arrow key. Choose the correct folder by pressing f.

You can save a directory by pressing f and next time you want it, press o.
When a song is playing you can use the mouse to control the speed. Push it away from you to speed up and towards you to slow down. You can also make the song stop by left clicking.


Current bugs:
When you are looking at a list of songs, if the list is too long, then you will not be able to see the last songs. you cannot scroll.
